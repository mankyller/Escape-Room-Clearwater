It's graduation day at Clearwater Academy, and excitement is in the air.
But there's a twist! Dr. Volt, your eccentric science teacher, has always emphasized the importance of
practical knowledge. Today, he's decided to put that philosophy to the ultimate test. Just hours before the
ceremony, Dr. Volt has locked you and your classmates in the science lab and created a secret 4-digit
code that you must use to escape.

DIRECTIONS:
Each room has a puzzle to solve and "clues" revealed based on your answers to the puzzle. You will
end up with a final four-digit code to escape the science lab.
